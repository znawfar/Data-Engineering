# Data Engineering With Python


>Extracting, Transforming, and Loading are three steps in the Data Engineering process.
Data extraction is getting data from multiple sources. In this notebook, I will extract information from the data that are stored in various formats:
- CSV
- JSON
- XLSX
- XML
 
 >As well as I will use the PIL library to read the **Image file**.

      
 **Just a Note:**

   #### Read/Save some Data Formats:
    

| Data Formate   |     Read    | Save | 
| --- |              ---       | --- |
| csv |           pd.read_csv()  | df.to_csv() |
| json|   pd.read_json() | df.to_json() |
| excel|   pd.read_excel() | df.to_excel() | 
| hdf |   pd.read_hdf() | df.to_hdf() |
| sql |   pd.read_sql() | df.to_sql() |
